# Time-Series-Modeling


This Time Series Modeling project was a group project of 7 people that I was a part of for my Statistical Methods in Finance class. The goal of the project was to predict the stock return of Coca-Cola 30 days into the future using the ARIMA, SVM, and GARCH models. We were to compare the performance of these three models. My contribution to the project was to implement the SVM model and deliver a live presentation to the class of the results of the model.
