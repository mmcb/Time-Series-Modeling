# Time-Series-Modeling


This Time Series Modeling project was a group project of 7 people that I was a part of for my Statistical Methods in Finance class. The goal of the project was to predict the stock return of Coca-Cola 30 days into the future using the ARIMA, SVM, and GARCH models. We were to compare the performance of these three models. I was responsible for implementing the SVM model and delivering a live presentation of the results of this model.
